# Privacy Policy for RemindMew

**Effective Date: December 13, 2025**  


## 1. Introduction
RemindMew (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is a mobile application designed to help you create reminders, journal, and receive optional AI-generated insights. This Privacy Policy explains what data is processed, where it is processed, and why.

**The short version:** Your reminders and journal entries are stored **locally on your device**. We do **not** run user accounts and we do **not** store your content on our own servers. We use **OpenAI** to generate AI content when you request it, and we use **Firebase Analytics** to understand app usage and improve the product.

## 2. Data Stored on Your Device (Local-Only)
The App stores the following data locally on your phone/tablet:
- Reminders you create (including time and repeat settings)
- Notes you add to reminders (e.g., goals, actions, affirmations, gratitude)
- Journal entries (including mood, title, and content)
- App settings and preferences

We do not automatically back up this data to our own servers. If you delete the App or clear its storage, this data may be deleted from your device.

## 3. Data We Collect
We collect limited data only for the purposes described below.

### 3.1 Firebase Analytics (Usage Statistics)
We use **Firebase Analytics** (provided by Google) to measure app usage and improve features. This may include:
- App interactions and events (e.g., creating/updating/deleting a reminder, generating an AI message, opening Weekly Insights)
- Basic device/app information (e.g., platform, app version), and identifiers used by Firebase for analytics measurement

**We do not intentionally send your reminder text or journal content to Firebase Analytics.** Analytics is used to understand overall usage trends, not to identify you personally.

Learn more about Google/Firebase data practices: `https://policies.google.com/privacy`.

### 3.2 AI Requests (OpenAI)
When you request AI features (e.g., motivational messages, voice generation, weekly insights), the App sends the relevant text you provide (such as your selected tone, goals, reminder notes, and/or journal entries) for processing.

**How it works technically:** requests are routed through a secure proxy endpoint hosted on **Firebase / Google Cloud** (used to protect the OpenAI API key). The proxy forwards your request to **OpenAI**, receives the response, and returns it to the App.  
**We do not store your AI prompts or responses on our own servers** as part of normal operation.

OpenAI’s Privacy Policy: `https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/`.

### 3.3 Feedback (Formspree)
If you choose to send feedback from within the App, the text you submit is sent through **Formspree** (a third-party form provider) and delivered to our email inbox so we can improve the App.  
Formspree’s Privacy Policy: `https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy/`.

## 4. Data We Do Not Collect (On Our Servers)
We do not create accounts and we do not store the following on our own servers:
- Your reminders, journal entries, and personal notes
- Your name, email address, phone number (unless you voluntarily send it in feedback outside the App)
- Your precise GPS location

## 5. Sharing and Disclosure
We share data only with service providers used to operate the App:
- **Google (Firebase Analytics / Google Cloud)** for analytics and proxy hosting
- **OpenAI** for AI content generation when you request AI features
- **Formspree** if you submit feedback

We do not sell your personal information.

## 6. Security
We use reasonable technical measures to protect data in transit (e.g., HTTPS to service providers). However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for securing access to your device.

## 7. Your Choices
- **Delete local data**: you can delete reminders/journal entries inside the App. Uninstalling the App typically removes local data stored by the App.
- **AI input**: avoid entering sensitive personal information (e.g., medical details, financial details, passwords) into journal entries or notes that you may choose to send for AI processing.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
RemindMew is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last Updated” date above.
