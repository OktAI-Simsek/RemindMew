# Privacy Policy for RemindMew

**Last Updated: December 9, 2025**

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to RemindMew ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience while using our mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

**The short version:** We do not collect, store, or sell your personal data. Your data stays on your device, except when it is processed by our AI service provider (OpenAI) to generate personalized content for you.

## 2. Data We Do Not Collect
We do not operate a backend server that stores your account information, journal entries, reminders, or personal notes. We do not collect:
- Your name, email, or phone number.
- Your location data.
- Your usage data for tracking purposes.

## 3. Data Storage
All information you enter into the App (including reminders, journal entries, goals, affirmations, and settings) is stored locally on your device using your device's internal storage. You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time by deleting the content within the App or uninstalling the App.

## 4. AI Services and Third-Party Data Processing
To provide the App's core features—such as generating personalized motivational messages and weekly insights—we use **OpenAI** as a third-party service provider.

- **How it works:** When you request an AI-generated message or report, the text content you have provided (e.g., your goals, journal entries, mood) is securely transmitted to OpenAI's API for processing.
- **Data Handling:** OpenAI processes this data solely to generate the response and returns it to the App. We do not authorize OpenAI to use your data to train their models.
- **Privacy Policy:** We encourage you to review OpenAI's Privacy Policy to understand how they handle data: [https://openai.com/policies/privacy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy).

## 5. Feedback
If you choose to send us feedback via the App, the content of your feedback (and any contact information you voluntarily provide) will be sent to us via a third-party form service (Formspree). We use this information solely to improve the App and respond to your inquiries.

## 6. Children's Privacy
The App is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
